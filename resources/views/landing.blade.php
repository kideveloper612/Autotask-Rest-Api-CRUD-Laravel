        <p>Autotask is a cloud based business management software platform that enables users to manage billing, scheduling, employee tracking and clients. The Autotask API exposes the functionality of their platform and allows it to be integrated with third party applications.</p>
        <p>Autotask exposes their API as a complex SOAP API, but weâ€™ve done the work for you and created a REST API for Autotask that takes away the complexity of integrating to their endpoint.</p>
